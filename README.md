FitBit Fitness Tracker App Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing user data from the FitBit Fitness Tracker App, collected through a distributed survey. The dataset includes information from 33 users across 18 sources, covering daily and hourly activity, calories burned, steps taken, heart rate, sleep patterns, and weight logs.

Project Highlights:
- Data Preparation: Cleaned, merged, and profiled the data using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib). 
- New features were engineered to derive deeper insights, and data validation was conducted to ensure integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
- Visualized trends in user activity levels, calories burned, sleep patterns, and heart rate. 
- Generated reports with Pandas Profiling for comprehensive insights into user behavior.


Key Insights:
- Users spend 81% of their day being sedentary.
- Peak calorie burn occurs at 6 p.m., with a drop after 7 p.m.
- Users maintain a consistent sleep schedule, but 44.3% sleep less than 7 hours per night.
- There is a strong correlation between total steps taken and calories burned.

Business Recommendations:
- Send personalized notifications to encourage users to stay active and sleep adequately.
- Introduce friendly competitions and motivational content to boost user engagement.
- Implement exercise modes and set a limit on sedentary minutes to promote healthier habits.

Tools used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Pandas Profiling, Git.
